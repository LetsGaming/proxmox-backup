  Proxmox Automated Backup System
```

Backs up a Proxmox node — configs, VM/CT definitions, SSH keys, firewall rules, package state, and per-VM application bundles — to a USB stick. Optionally syncs offsite with AES-256 encryption.

**Power-loss safe. Atomic commit. One config file. Self-contained restore script in every backup.**

---

## Install

**Requires:** Proxmox VE 7.x or 8.x · root access · a partitioned USB stick · internet access during setup only

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pabs /opt/pabs
chmod +x /opt/pabs/*.sh
sudo bash /opt/pabs/setup.sh
```

The wizard handles everything: dependencies, USB config, VM agents, offsite sync, cron schedule. Safe to re-run.

After setup, restrict the config file:

```bash
chmod 600 /opt/pabs/config.sh
```

---

## Restore

```bash
cd /mnt/backup-usb/proxmox-backup/2026-05-25_03-00-00/
./proxmox-restore.sh
```

Every backup is self-contained — `proxmox-restore.sh` and `DISASTER-RECOVERY.md` are written into each backup folder at backup time. No dependency on this repo at restore time. Use `--dry-run` to preview, `--section ssh` to target a single section.

## How it works

All data stages on the host's local SSD first, gets SHA256-verified, then transfers to USB in a single atomic commit. A second verification runs on USB after transfer. A partial write never appears as a complete backup.

| Guarantee | Detail |
| :-------- | :----- |
| Staged write | USB sees one sequential write — no partial-file corruption |
| UUID targeting | Refuses to write to any drive other than `TARGET_UUID` |
| Atomic commit | Written to `<date>.tmp/` then renamed — power loss leaves a `.tmp/`, not a corrupt backup |
| Dual verification | SHA256 manifest checked on SSD before transfer, re-checked on USB after |
| Auto space recovery | Purges oldest backup if USB is full; refuses if it's the last copy |
| Offsite sync | AES-256 via rclone crypt; failure is non-fatal, USB backup is always intact |

## What gets backed up

**Proxmox host (always):** `/etc/pve/`, network interfaces, SSH keys, firewall rules, cron jobs, APT sources, ZFS/LVM layout, package selections, `/usr/local/bin/`, `/root/scripts/`.

**Per-VM agent bundles (optional):**

| Type | What's collected |
| :--- | :--------------- |
| `docker` | All `docker-compose.yml` + `.env` files, named volumes (under threshold), daemon config |
| `haos` | Full native HA snapshot via `ha` CLI — one-click restore in HA UI |
| `minecraft` | Weekly `.tar.zst` archives, `server.properties`, mods, plugins |
| `generic` | `/etc/` (full), cron jobs, `/usr/local/bin/`, `/root/scripts/`, package list |

VM disk images are not backed up — agent bundles contain full application state. Rebuild path: fresh OS → `install-agent.sh` → restore bundle.

## Health check

```bash
/opt/pabs/pabs-status.sh
```

Reports USB mount state, drive health (kernel I/O errors, filesystem error counters, SMART), latest backup integrity, VM agent reachability, and offsite status. Exit codes: `0` OK · `1` error · `2` warning.
