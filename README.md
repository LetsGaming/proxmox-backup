# PABS — Proxmox Automated Backup System

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Proxmox%20VE-7.x%20%E2%80%93%209.x-e57000.svg)](https://www.proxmox.com/)
[![Shell](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shell-Bash%205%2B-4EAA25.svg)](backup.sh)
[![Tests](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tests-BATS-brightgreen.svg)](tests/pabs.bats)

Backs up a Proxmox node to a USB stick: configs, VM/CT definitions, SSH keys, firewall rules, package state, and per-VM application bundles. Optionally syncs offsite with AES-256 encryption.

Power-loss safe. Atomic commit. One config file. Self-contained restore script in every backup.

---

## Requirements

- Proxmox VE 7.x – 9.x
- Root access
- A USB stick formatted as ext4 (the setup wizard can format it)
- Internet access during initial setup only

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LetsGaming/PABS.git /opt/pabs
chmod +x /opt/pabs/*.sh
sudo bash /opt/pabs/setup.sh
```

The wizard handles dependencies, USB config, VM agents, offsite sync, and the cron schedule. Safe to re-run at any time.

After setup, lock down the config file:

```bash
chmod 600 /opt/pabs/config.sh
```

**Updating PABS** — your `config.sh` is preserved automatically:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/pabs/setup.sh --update
```

---

## Restore

Every backup is self-contained. `proxmox-restore.sh` and `DISASTER-RECOVERY.md` are written into each backup folder at backup time — this repository is not needed at restore time.

```bash
cd /mnt/backup-usb/proxmox-backup/2026-05-25_03-00-00/
./proxmox-restore.sh
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview without writing, or `--section ssh` to target a single section.

## How it works

All data stages on the host SSD first, is SHA256-verified, then transferred to USB in a single atomic commit. A second verification runs on USB after transfer. A partial write never appears as a complete backup.

| Guarantee | Detail |
| :-------- | :----- |
| Staged write | USB receives one sequential write — no partial-file corruption |
| UUID targeting | Refuses to write to any drive other than `TARGET_UUID` |
| Atomic commit | Written to `<date>.tmp/` then renamed — power loss leaves a `.tmp/`, not a corrupt backup |
| Dual verification | SHA256 manifest checked on SSD before transfer, re-checked on USB after |
| Auto space recovery | Purges oldest backup if USB is full; refuses if it is the last copy |
| Offsite sync | AES-256 via rclone crypt; failure is non-fatal, USB backup is always intact |

---

## What gets backed up

**Proxmox host (always):** `/etc/pve/`, network interfaces, SSH keys, firewall rules, cron jobs, APT sources, ZFS/LVM layout, package selections, `/usr/local/bin/`, `/root/scripts/`.

**Per-VM agent bundles (optional):**

| Type | What is collected |
| :--- | :---------------- |
| `docker` | All `docker-compose.yml` + `.env` files, named volumes (under threshold), daemon config |
| `haos` | Full native HA snapshot via `ha` CLI — one-click restore in the HA UI |
| `minecraft` | Weekly `.tar.zst` archives, `server.properties`, mods, plugins |
| `generic` | `/etc/` (full), cron jobs, `/usr/local/bin/`, `/root/scripts/`, package list |

VM disk images are not backed up. Agent bundles contain full application state. Rebuild path: fresh OS → `install-agent.sh` → restore bundle.

---

## Health check

```bash
/opt/pabs/pabs-status.sh
```

Reports USB mount state, drive health (kernel I/O errors, filesystem error counters, SMART), latest backup integrity, VM agent reachability, and offsite status.

Exit codes: `0` OK · `1` error · `2` warning.
