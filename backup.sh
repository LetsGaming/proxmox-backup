# PABS — Proxmox Automated Backup System
# Version 3.4
#
# Entry point. Sources config and library files, then runs the backup.
# The only logic here is the top-level execution sequence.
#
# File layout:
#   backup.sh              ← you are here (run this)
#   config.sh              ← edit this to configure your setup
#   setup.sh               ← interactive setup wizard (start here)
#   lib/core.sh            ← logging, lock, trap, notifications
#   lib/offsite.sh         ← rclone encryption, upload, retention pruning
#   lib/preflight.sh       ← pre-flight validation checks
#   lib/sections.sh        ← 8 backup section functions + helpers
#   helpers/manifest.sh    ← SHA256 manifest generation/verification, rotation
#   helpers/output.sh      ← generates restore script and README inside each backup
#   vm-agent/agent.sh      ← deployed to VMs/LXCs for lightweight agent backups
#   install-agent.sh       ← one-time setup: deploys vm-agent to a VM over SSH
#   setup/                 ← wizard modules (ui, config_editor, step handlers)
#
# Usage:
#   ./backup.sh               — normal backup run
#   ./backup.sh --dry-run     — preflight checks + section log only, no writes
#   (schedule with cron: 0 3 * * 0 /path/to/pabs/backup.sh)
