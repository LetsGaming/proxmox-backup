# LOCAL STAGING
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# All backup data is assembled here on the Proxmox host's own disk first.
# The USB drive sees only a single sequential write at the very end.
# This directory needs enough free space to hold one full backup
# (roughly: all configs + VM agent bundles combined).
#
# DEFAULT: /var/tmp/pabs-stage  (survives reboots, lives on root LVM)
#
# ⚠  On Proxmox nodes with a small root partition (common with LVM-thin or
#    ZFS installs), root may only be 20–30 GB. If your archives are large,
#    point this at a bigger volume instead:
#
#    ZFS install:        LOCAL_STAGE_BASE="/rpool/data/pabs-stage"
#    Directory storage:  LOCAL_STAGE_BASE="/mnt/pve/mystore/pabs-stage"
#
# The script will warn at startup if the staging filesystem is the same
# device as / and has less than LOCAL_STAGE_WARN_GB free.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# VM / LXC AGENT BACKUPS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each entry backs up one VM or LXC using the PABS agent installed on that
# host. The agent auto-detects the VM type and produces a minimal,
# restore-ready bundle:
#
#   docker  — all docker-compose.yml + .env files, Docker daemon config,
#             package list. Works with or without a manager (Dockge, Portainer).
#   haos    — full native HA snapshot (.tar) via the ha CLI — one-click
#             restore via the HA UI or ha backup restore <slug>.
#   generic — /etc (full), cron jobs, scripts, package list. Covers Pi-hole,
#             AdGuard, Nginx, and any plain Debian/Ubuntu LXC or VM.
#
# The agent is deployed once per VM with install-agent.sh, and its behaviour
# is configured via /etc/pabs-agent/config on each VM. See INTEGRATION.md
# for the full setup guide and all available options.
#
# FORMAT:  "label  ip-or-hostname  ssh-user  /path/to/agent.sh"
#
#   label       Short name. Used for the backup subfolder and log output.
#               Must be unique. Use lowercase-with-dashes.
#   ip/host     Address reachable from this Proxmox host.
#   ssh-user    SSH user on the VM. Needs read access to config paths,
#               write access to /tmp, and permission to run the agent.
#               Typically 'root' for LXCs, or a dedicated 'backup' user.
#   agent-path  Full path to agent.sh on the remote VM.
#               Default install location: /opt/pabs-agent/agent.sh
#
# EXAMPLE:
#   VM_AGENTS=(
#       "docker-vm    192.168.1.10   root    /opt/pabs-agent/agent.sh"
#       "haos         192.168.1.20   root    /opt/pabs-agent/agent.sh"
#       "pihole-lxc   192.168.1.30   root    /opt/pabs-agent/agent.sh"
#       "adguard-lxc  192.168.1.31   backup  /opt/pabs-agent/agent.sh"

# OPTIONAL FEATURES
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Set to "true" to export ZFS pool/dataset layout into system-state/
# Default is "true" because ZFS is the standard Proxmox installer choice since PVE 6.x.
# Set to "false" only on setups that do not use ZFS at all.
BACKUP_ZFS="true"

# Offsite sync via rclone — provides the third copy for 3-2-1 backup compliance.
# Runs after each successful USB commit. Non-fatal: USB backup is always intact.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   apt install rclone
#   rclone config  — set up a named remote (e.g. "gdrive", "onedrive", "backblaze")
#
# Examples:
#   RCLONE_REMOTE="gdrive:proxmox-backup"        # Google Drive (15 GB free)
#   RCLONE_REMOTE="onedrive:proxmox-backup"      # OneDrive (5 GB free)
#   RCLONE_REMOTE="backblaze:my-bucket/proxmox"  # Backblaze B2
#   RCLONE_REMOTE="hetzner-sftp:backup/proxmox"  # any SFTP/S3-compatible remote
#
# Only the base remote is configured here. If RCLONE_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD is set,
# PABS automatically wraps this remote with rclone's crypt layer — no extra
# rclone config steps required for encryption.
#
# Leave empty to disable offsite sync entirely.
RCLONE_REMOTE=""

# Extra rclone flags — bandwidth limit, parallel transfers, etc.
# "--bwlimit 5M" caps upload at 5 MB/s to avoid saturating the uplink.
RCLONE_EXTRA_OPTS="--bwlimit 5M"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OFFSITE RETENTION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Controls how many backups to keep on the offsite remote and how much storage
# to consume. Useful for fitting within free-tier limits (OneDrive 5 GB,
# Google Drive 15 GB) while guaranteeing a minimum number of restore points.
#
# RCLONE_KEEP_MIN  — Never delete below this many offsite backups, even if
#                    RCLONE_KEEP_MAX or RCLONE_MAX_STORAGE_GB would require it.
#                    Set to 1 to always keep at least one offsite copy.
#
# RCLONE_KEEP_MAX  — Prune oldest offsite backups once this count is exceeded.
#                    Set to 0 to disable count-based pruning (rely on storage cap only).
#
# RCLONE_MAX_STORAGE_GB — Hard cap on total remote storage used by PABS (in GB).
#                         Oldest backups are pruned to stay under this limit,
#                         but never below RCLONE_KEEP_MIN.
#                         Set to 0 to disable storage-based pruning.
#
# Example — free-tier OneDrive (5 GB), always keep at least 1 backup:
#   RCLONE_KEEP_MIN=1
#   RCLONE_KEEP_MAX=2
#   RCLONE_MAX_STORAGE_GB=4   # leave 1 GB headroom on the 5 GB free tier
#
# Example — paid remote, keep up to a month of weeklies:
#   RCLONE_KEEP_MIN=2
#   RCLONE_KEEP_MAX=8
#   RCLONE_MAX_STORAGE_GB=0   # no storage cap
RCLONE_KEEP_MIN=1
RCLONE_KEEP_MAX=4
RCLONE_MAX_STORAGE_GB=0

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OFFSITE ENCRYPTION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Encrypts all offsite data using rclone's built-in crypt remote. The crypt
# layer is created automatically at runtime — no extra rclone config steps
# needed. Your base remote (RCLONE_REMOTE) is configured once normally; PABS
# wraps it transparently when a password is set.
#
# This means you do not need to trust your cloud provider with your data.
# The provider sees only opaque encrypted blobs — filenames are encrypted too.
#
# RCLONE_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD — Main passphrase. Leave empty to disable encryption.
#                              Required to restore: store this passphrase safely
#                              (e.g. in a password manager), separately from the
#                              USB backup itself.
#
# RCLONE_ENCRYPTION_SALT     — Optional second passphrase (rclone "password2").
#                              Protects against rainbow-table attacks on the main
#                              password. Recommended if you use a short password.
#                              Leave empty to skip (still secure with a strong
#                              main password).
#
# ⚠  These values are automatically REDACTED in the config.sh copy written to
#    USB, so they do not travel with the local backup.
